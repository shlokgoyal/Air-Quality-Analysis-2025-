# Air Quality Analysis
This project analyzes air quality data across various Indian states using pollutant-level measurements. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the creation of a "Breathability Risk Index" (BRI) to categorize the relative air pollution risk per state. The insights can aid public health understanding, policy making, and risk assessment for insurance or environmental planning.

## Project Structure
* aq_data_230525.csv: Raw dataset containing air pollution levels and metadata.
* preprocessing.py: Script for cleaning and imputing missing values.
* EDA.py: Exploratory Data Analysis and BRI computation.
* map_visuals_bri.py: Generates an interactive map visualization for BRI across states.

## üå´Ô∏è Pollutants
The dataset tracks concentrations of seven key air pollutants. Each pollutant affects health and the environment in distinct ways:

## üßπ Data Preprocessing
Steps taken in preprocessing.py:
1. Column Cleanup: Removed the country column (only one country present).
2. Date Formatting: Converted last_update to datetime.
3. Missing Values Handling:
  * Used pollutant-specific averages to impute missing values for pollutant_min, pollutant_max, and pollutant_avg.
  * Missing values were not dropped to preserve geographic and temporal diversity in the data.
4. Export: Cleaned data saved to aq_data_230525_cleaned.csv.


## üìä Data Analysis
Performed using EDA.py:
* Descriptive Statistics: Examined distributions, means, and medians for pollutants.
* Visualizations:
  * Histograms for each pollutant showing mean vs. median.
  * Box plots grouped by pollutant_id.
* Breathability Risk Index (BRI):
  * Weighted scoring based on pollutant concentration using the following weights:
      * PM2.5: 0.30
      * PM10: 0.20
      * NO2: 0.15
      * SO2: 0.10
      * CO: 0.10
      * OZONE: 0.10
      * NH3: 0.05
* Normalized and scaled BRI scores (0‚Äì10).
* Categorized into:
  * Low Risk: BRI < 3
  * Moderate Risk: 3 ‚â§ BRI < 6
  * High Risk: BRI ‚â• 6
* State-wise Pollutant Analysis: Bar plots of pollutant levels by state and associated BRI categories.

    * State-wise BRI
    * Risk categories via color-coded markers:
      
      üü¢ Low Risk
      üü† Moderate Risk
      üî¥ High Risk

## üß† Conclusion & Insights

* PM2.5 and PM10 are the most influential pollutants in determining air quality risk.
* Urban and industrialized states generally showed higher BRI scores, indicating more polluted air.
* States with lower pollution risk may benefit from preventive regulation, while high-risk regions require immediate mitigation strategies.
* The BRI metric simplifies communication of air quality health risk and can be used by stakeholders like:
  * Public health agencies
  * Environmental bodies
  * Insurance companies
